==================
Basic-Notepad
==================

It's a simple notepad using QT libraries.
You must have QT installed to compile the application.
To compile go like this:
1. 'cd' to dircectory containig the application files.
2. then type the following on the terminal.
	qmake-qt4

3. This should create a MakeFile in the current directory.
4. Now you can run 'make'
5. You should have an executable 'notepad' in current directory.
6. Just run this executable and you can use the simple and very basic notepad.

Thankyou.
